> "Can I submit more books?"

**Yes!** If you want to suggest a new book, just open an issue and tell us which book we should add here.

**OBS**: After **10** people approve (:+1:) your suggestion, the book will be included in our list.

> "Can I suggest a new book for the Essential Path"

**Yes!** But keep in mind that we will maintain just **one book** for each topic. If the book that you are suggesting is from a topic that we already have, we will change the previous book with the one suggested by you.

**OBS**: After at least **20** people approve (:+1:) your suggestion, the book and/or the new topic will be included in our list.
